played thru the demo again:
some observations

- "destroy"ing yourself will occassionally freeze the program at "game over"
  or throw a red error
  - destroy doesn't seem to throw any errors if done on an enemy

- couldn't find a way to clear the "push" or "jump" versions 
  of the first level
  - in "push" it's not possible to get past that first corner
    bc you don't have pull or swap
  - in "jump" I couldn't find a "swap" or a "pull" that 
    would let me get past the mutexes surrounding the exit

- the game kinda lags once you get out into the larger part of level 1
